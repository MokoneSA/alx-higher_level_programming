# JavaScript Warm Up

This project contains some tasks for learning the basics of JavaScript.

## Tasks To Complete
#### 0. First constant, first print
`0-javascript_is_amazing.js` contains a script that prints "JavaScript is amazing":

- You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value "JavaScript is amazing".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 1. 3 languages
`1-multi_languages.js` contains a script that prints 3 lines:

- The first line: "C is fun".
- The second line: "Python is cool".
- The third line: "JavaScript is amazing".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 2. Arguments
`2-arguments.js` contains a script that prints a message depending on the number of arguments passed:

- If no arguments are passed to the script, print "No argument".
- If only one argument is passed to the script, print "Argument found".
- Otherwise, print "Arguments found".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 3. Value of my argument
`3-value_argument.js` contains a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

- If no arguments are passed to the script, print "No argument".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
- You are not allowed to use length.

#### 4. Create a sentence
`4-concat.js` contains a script that prints the two arguments passed to it in the following format: <first argument> is <second argument>

- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 5. An Integer
`5-to_integer.j` contains a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer.

- If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print "Not a number".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
- You are not allowed to use try/catch.
 
#### 6. Loop to languages
`6-multi_languages_loop.js` contains a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of strings and a loop.

- The first line: "C is fun".
- The second line: "Python is cool".
- The third line: "JavaScript is amazing".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
- You are not allowed to use any if/else statement.
- You can use only one console.log.
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).
 
#### 7. I love C
`7-multi_c.js` contains a script that prints "C is fun" x times.

- Wherex is the first argument of the script.
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print "Missing number of occurrences".
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
- You can use only two console.log.
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).

#### 8. Square
`8-square.js` contains a script that prints a square.

- The first argument is the size of the square.
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print "Missing size".
- You must use the character X to print the square.
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).

#### 9. Add
`9-add.js` contains a script that prints the addition of 2 integers.

- The first argument is the first integer.
- The second argument is the second integer.
- You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b).
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 10. Factorial
`10-factorial.js` contains a script that computes and prints a factorial.

- The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
- Factorial of NaN is 1.
- You must do it recursively.
- You must use a function.
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 11. Second biggest!
`11-second_biggest.js` contains a scrpt that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

- You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer.
- If no argument passed, print 0.
- If the number of arguments is 1, print 0.
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 12. Object
`12-object.js` updates a script to replace the value 12 with 89:

- You are not allowed to use var.
The script to update:
```JavaScript
#!/usr/bin/node
const myObject = {
  type: 'object',
  value: 12
};
console.log(myObject);
/*
YOUR CODE HERE
*/
console.log(myObject);
```
#### 13. Add file
`13-add.js` contains a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.

- The function must be visible from outside.
- The name of the function must be add.
- You are not allowed to use var.

#### 14. Const or not const
100-let_me_const.js contains a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333.

#### 15. Call me Moby
`101-call_me_moby.js` contains a function that executes a function x times.

- The function must be visible from outside.
- Prototype: function (x, theFunction).
- You are not allowed to use var.

#### 16. Add me maybe
`102-add_me_maybe.js` contains a function that increments a number and calls a function with the number as its argument.

- The function must be visible from outside.
- Prototype: function (number, theFunction).
- You are not allowed to use var.
 
#### 17. Increment object
`103-object_fct.js` updates a script by adding a new function incr that increments the integer value.

You are not allowed to use var.
The script to update:
```JavaScript
#!/usr/bin/node
const myObject = {
  type: 'object',
  value: 12
};
console.log(myObject);
/*
YOUR CODE HERE
*/
myObject.incr();
console.log(myObject);
myObject.incr();
console.log(myObject);
myObject.incr();
console.log(myObject);
```
